## Gold-And-Silver-Prices-EDA-
#Overview:
In this portfolio project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both gold and silver prices using Python and various data manipulation and visualization libraries. I imported historical price data in CSV format, structured it for analysis, and performed analyses on both precious metals. Visualizations were created to enhance data insights and communicate findings effectively.

#Tasks performed:

1. Data Import and Preparation:
Imported historical gold and silver price data in CSV format.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and outliers.

2. Silver and Gold Price Analysis:
Conducted exploratory analysis to understand trends and patterns in both silver and gold prices.
Calculated descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation for both metals.
Identified fluctuations and anomalies in both silver and gold prices.

3. Visualization:
Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a variety of visualizations.
Produced line charts to visualize price trends over time for both silver and gold.
Created box plots to display price distributions and variations for both metals.
Designed heatmaps and correlation matrices to explore relationships within the datasets.

4.Conclusions and Insights:
Summarized key findings from the analyses of both precious metals.
Presented insights into the behavior of gold and silver prices.
Discussed any notable correlations or anomalies discovered during the combined analysis.

#Tools used:
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
CSV files for data storage and import

This portfolio project showcases my proficiency in conducting comprehensive data analysis and visualization on precious metal prices, offering insights into their historical behavior and potential relationships between them.
